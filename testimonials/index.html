<div class="tldr" style="padding-top: 1rem">
<p>I was introduced to Robert in 2009, and it was probably the most fortuitous introduction of my career. My Cognician co-founder, Barry, and I were working with a programmer who was building a prototype for our software. The programmer told me that he'd run out of skill to realise our vision, but he knew a guy who could help, and that was Robert. Robert, Barry and I hit it off immediately and so began a collaboration that continues to this day.</p>
<p>Robert's outstanding technical prowess, as both an architect and a builder, is matched only by his extraordinary ability to communicate with everyone in the business. He doesn't simply provide the bridge between &quot;business&quot; and &quot;tech&quot;, he optimises the communication by clarifying requirements on both sides, in terms that both groups understand, by making sure we know what problem we're solving, and how we're going to solve it.</p>
<p>This ability to cut through noise has saved Cognician from travelling down a myriad dead end technical paths. And it has frequently future-proofed us by adopting technology, and technological approaches that have had incredible longevity and efficacy.</p>
<p>This truly rare set of characteristics have also made him a mentor and friend to our whole team, and I consider myself privileged to work with him every day. Technical people come to Cognician to work with and for Robert, and they frequently thank him in public for how he manages them, and helps to lift their game.</p>
<p>If you ever have the chance to work with Robert, don't think twice, just do it.</p>
