Hi, internet person! Thanks for popping by!

I'm Robert Stuttaford, a Clojure enthusiast living in Cape Town, South Africa.

I head up the tech team at [Cognician](https://www.cognician.com), an ed-tech company working on improving people's thinking.

I've appeared on [several podcasts and at conferences](/speaking/).
