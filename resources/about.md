I'm Robert Stuttaford, a Clojure enthusiast living in Cape Town, South Africa.

I head up the tech team as CTO at [Cognician](https://www.cognician.com), which provides digital coaching solutions to global management consultancies and their clients to improve productivity at scale.

<u>I'd love to chat!</u> [Direct Message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RobStuttaford), or [email me](mailto:robert.stuttaford+stuttaford.me@gmail.com).

I offer [consulting](/consulting/) on the Clojure stack, and everything that entails.

I've appeared on [several podcasts](/speaking/#podcast-appearances) and at [several conferences](/speaking/#conference-presentations).

I am a huge fan of positive psychology, the [Growth Mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/), leading with empathy, servant leadership, and many conceptual frameworks and mental models, such as:

- The [intrinsic motivators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc): Mastery, Autonomy, and Purpose.
- [Nonviolent Communication](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/aboutnvc/4partprocess.htm).
- The [Spine Model](http://spinemodel.info/).
- The need for [Deep Work](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/deep-work/).

I'm probably more of a [Mender than a Maker](https://www.slideshare.net/mscottford/old-code-new-tricks-75-minutes), but only just!

My StrengthsFinder strengths are:

*Intellection* • *Learner* • *Relator* • *Consistency* • *Harmony*
