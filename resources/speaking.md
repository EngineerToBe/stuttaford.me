*University of Cape Town CompSci dept, May 2013*

This talk wasn't recorded - here are the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/robertstuttaford/functional-programming-star-isnt-star-scary) and the [gist with demo source code](https://gist.github.com/robert-stuttaford/afdff1bdc79d0b6a616c), for posterity.

The audience for this talk were year 1/2/3 CompSci students, being fed a regular diet of .NET and Python programming in their respective courses. I was asked to come and talk about how 'all this functional programming stuff' is different, and why they might try it on.

#### Cognician's new architecture with Clojure and Datomic

*ScaleConf, April 2013* - [direct link](https://youtu.be/KlDJy3yXVsc) - [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/robertstuttaford/cognicians-new-architecture-with-clojure-and-datomic)

I was pretty nervous for this one - it was my first real public speaking adventure, and it was hundreds of people ðŸ™ˆ. 

I still managed to excite some people, because I remember the discussion during the break afterward being quite lively!
