Howdy, internet traveller!

Here I hope to share some of my experiences working with the Clojure stack when building the Cognician platform.

Topics will include technologies such as:

* [Clojure](http://clojure.org) itself
* [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), the Javascript variant
* [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org), the build tool for Clojure
* [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/), an immutable database built with Clojure
* [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om), a ClojureScript wrapper for Facebook's React Javascript library
* [Core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/), a Clojure library for coordinating sequential processes in Clojure programs

And plenty more!

At [Cognician](https://www.cognician.com), we built our second generation SaaS application stack wholly with Clojure, using all of the above and many more. Having done this stuff 'for real' for a couple years, I have many stories, tips, and how-tos to share.

Of course, all of this stuff is my opinion, and the opinions of those who I've chosen to agree with -- which brings us to the very important point that most of what I have to share, I learned from someone else in the community. I stand on the shoulders of giants :-)

Let's see where this goes!
